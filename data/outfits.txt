	description "The Plasma Blade's original purpose was to be a land-frame tool for mining, cutting, and general industrial work, and it was so incredibly effective that lighter versions have been developed as short range weapons for land-frame combat. This one has instead been made bigger, heavily modified by the rebels for use as a weapon in space, with the original case expanded to provide space for extra hardware and a standard mount. Sacrificing its original precision as a tool, it uses a lot more energy to deliver unmatched firepower at a very short range. The systems that generate the blade take a very long time to warm up, so when in use, it needs to stay in idle mode, constantly consuming power, and with the power requirements way beyond the original specifications, it requires constant maintenance."

	description "The technology behind this weapon is incomprehensibly complex, even for ancient Mata standards. With a pulse of negative energy, it creates a small rift in the fabric of space-time, and hits the target faster than light, ignoring anything in its path. While it is capable of piercing shields just as well, the interference from the matrix disrupts the field and lowers the damage, so Relic recommends pairing it with their own Chronovortex weapons to weaken shields first." 
	#"With a pulse of negative energy, it creates a linear rift in spacetime, generating extreme negative gravitational forces in its path that splits matter apart as if it wasn't there, going right through.

	description "This advanced warp-lance model generates a much tighter linear rift which is capable of doing much more damage through shields, but it never caught on, and isn't found in outfitters anymore. It uses much more power, the lower damage of the tighter beam hardly justifies the extra piercing, and makes it much less useful when shields are down. Regardless, a few mercenaries still prefer this version, and it has plenty of scientific value."

	description "While the Warp-Lance is powerful, the Chronovortex is efficient and versatile. Through unfathomable means, this weapon tangles the fabric of spacetime in such extreme ways that it forms closed time-like curves, where past and future can interact. Solid matter bends and crumbles under the chaos, and shield matrices are forced to interact with themselves, causing rapid failure. The chaotic space also slows down the enemy ship, which may give a tactical advantage. Relic advises that this machine does not enable time travel, and attempting to use it for this purpose will void warranty and most likely result in death."

	description "The Mata generally don't consider weapons that rely on ammo as a viable option in the vast uninhabited expanses of the Rift, and missiles that can get wasted on asteroids or shot down are hardly worth their cost when other weapons that are just as powerful exist. This is the exception to the rule."
	description "Taking inspiration from the warp-lances, this weapon accelerates a specially designed bomb into a warp chamber and teleports it straight into the target location, with no travel time, bypassing shields entirely to deliver a very powerful blow. This weapon is rightfully feared by everyone, and the only protection its targets can rely on is that it still needs to be pointed at them to work, and the teleportation is likely to miss at long distances"

	description "Made to counter the fact that the warp cannon doesn't teleport at angles, the turret version really makes missiles obsolete. The smaller turret mounted on a fast-swiveling base makes it virtually impossible to avoid, but the teleportation is still likely to miss at longer ranges. To save mass and make sure the turret is able to track any fast-moving target, this version doesn't impart kinetic energy onto the shells before teleporting them, instead relying only on their raw explosive power."

	description "This prototype Singularity Core makes ample use of the highest quality nihilite crystals for collecting energy, as well as improved gravitational stabilizers and mass dampeners, eliminating the problem of side-fumbling and allowing for a less massive - and much more powerful - singularity. However, it relies too much on incredibly rare and expensive materials that cannot be mass produced. The few existing prototypes are highly valuable, and people have been killed over their possession."

	description "Although even the most impure Nihilite is capable of holding as much energy as the most advanced chemical cells, to do so is considered unsafe and impractical due to the energy leakage that threatens to break down the crystal. Large, pure samples are expensive, rare, and also unsafe, as any damage to them while charged could result in an explosion comparable to a nuclear bomb, and thus requires a very complex containment system. To solve all of these problems, Slipstream innovates using tiny pure fragments, carefully extracted from impure crystals, arranged in a polycrystalline lattice. Any damage to the cell would only affect individual crystals without causing a chain reaction, making it safer, and it is still capable of holding as much energy as fissile material."

	description "The Afterlife System is the technology that differentiates Void Frames from normal spaceships, as well as other kinds of Frames used on air, land, and sea. This special pod is connected to a multitude of sensors, a specialized helper AI, and has space for one person - which is the only crew a Frame needs to operate. The pilot, known as a Ghost in Mata terms, is neurally connected to the Frame, which essentially becomes the Ghost's new body. Extensive training is required to get used to seeing the world through the provided sensors and moving with thrusters instead of limbs, and the costs to fulfill the specialized operational needs of this system are very high. But in return, such a fundamental connection increases situational awareness to a degree that allows the Ghost to micromanage aspects of the ship that would be impossible even for an advanced AI, redirecting shields to absorb incoming hits, and effortlessly maneuvering to take hits to well armored or non essential spots when dodging isn't possible. The adaptability that this system provides ensures that the Frame can never be rendered helpless."

	description "The inclusion of a second pod allows for two individuals to simultaneously operate a frame, which is great for training new Ghosts faster, but having two distinct, conflicting minds interacting with each other is a huge detriment to overall performance. While in theory, two well aligned minds could increase performance even further, the tolerance is incredibly tiny, and no such pairings have ever been found. Thus, every other Frame is equipped with a single pod."

	description "This is the medium size of the Magnetoplasmadynamic Thrusters, also known as MPDs. Developed by Slipstream, these engines save space by generating high energy plasma in a centralized location, and piping them to maneuvering units as needed. Usually they aren't very fast, but they come with an integrated afterburner mode, which is highly efficient. They are notorious for extremely high maneuverability, and when the afterburner mode is on, they go even faster than Relic's Warp Drives."

	description "The warp drive works not by moving the ship around space, but by moving space itself around the ship. By isolating the vessel within its own bubble of spacetime, it resists slowing effects. It is not great at turning, but it accelerates quickly, both forwards and backwards. Uniquely, it is capable of functioning as a hyperdrive as well, each engine increasing the speed at which it is capable to jump, but it is a very power-hungry machine, demanding a constant energy supply to idle, and even more when moving."

It features many firing modes, from standard plasma shots that pack more of a punch than any human gun, to charged explosive shots that act like a grenade, and even a short ranged stream of plasma that works as a flamethrower, with much higher temperatures. A non-lethal mode can deliver a powerful electric shock from the rails on the muzzle, and if you need to level a building, the Nihilite battery that powers it can serve as a very powerful improvised explosive."

However, they are not intelligent enough to effectively engage in combat without a trainer, and cannot understand tactics, making them liable to turn on their allies if their trainer is killed. A constant supply of food is also necessary to feed them."
